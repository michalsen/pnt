7.31.17

First day for the 100th aniversary for the Battle of Passchendaele, and here I
am pushing my first D8 module.
It isn't much, and is about half down, but wanted to get it up for review.

Basically it adds a custom class to specific webforms for event tracking.

There is some error messaging I need to fix after I make the hook_form_alter()
dynamic to the choices from the admin page.
